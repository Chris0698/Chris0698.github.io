Their website had no membership capabilities, user login/sign-up capabilities, multilingual support, and no area where members could share their creative ideas.

This prototype also featured changing the page language through a link in the top right of the page. This worked by loading a .ini file that contained key-value pairs for each translation, while in the PHP code, the .ini file would be loaded, then each sentence would be set. This did have the disadvantage of requiring the page to be reload each time the language was changed. Unfortunately, due to the database being lost, most of the UI and functionality is gone."),n.createElement("p",null,"The second prototype made use of React to build the UI, this worked much better since it did not rely on PHP nor did it require the website to be reloaded each time the language was changed. Instead, a JSON file contained the key-value pairs and the i8N module was imported in NPM to load the JSON. There was no database for this prototype during the time it was developed."),n.createElement("p",null,"We also had to think also think about UI and UX for the designs, and making sure the website was visible to search engines for a good SEO index rank.

It was decided that we would set up a web server using NginX and Google cloud."),n.createElement("p",null,"Unfortunately, the project was never picked up.
