AngularJS was used to "stich" the elements togthers and to make the website a single page application. To begin i created a route provider and a controller for functionality like film click, logging in, closing the note editor etc. A data service JS file was created as a middle man between the front end controller and the PHP service pipe (explained next paragraph). The data service contained multiple functions which each used data promises and returned the promise to the controller which was the result from the PHP service pipe.

Additionally i had a "service pipe" PHP file where the JS data servuce file would pass arguements to, and inside the PHP service pipe file it had different SQL to select and undate data, depending on the arguements passed. These queries made use of the JSON record set class and the result was JSON encoded and echoed out for the JS files. Try-catch blocks was used for each query and the exception was error logged.')),r.createElement("div",{className:"projectInfoCol2"},r.createElement("p",null,"Date: 2019"),r.createElement("p",null,"Module mark: 80"),r.createElement("a",{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener no referrer",href:"https://github.com/Chris0698/WebApp",className:"codeButton"},"View Code"))))}}}]);
