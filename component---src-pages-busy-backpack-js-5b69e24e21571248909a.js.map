This is where i presented this prototype to show that it was possible.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Effectively what i produced were two prototypes, one made in React and had no application backend, where the other prototype was made using HTML and did have a PHP backend with a database. \n            I was new to React at the time so i did not know how to get PHP to work with React.\n            Both prototypes followed the design set in the existing website and added the extra features on top.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The prototype produced in HTML and OOPHP showed how the membership sign-up and log-in could work. Users would sign in to the site and when looking at events, they shown two buttons,\n            if they were interested in the event, or intend on going, and in the admin page, the admin could see a list of how many clicked like or interested and which are the more popular events.\n            This prototype also featured changing the page language through a link in the top right of the page. This worked by loading a .ini file that contained key-value pairs for each translation, while in the PHP code, the .ini file would be loaded,\n            then each sentence would be set. This did have the disadvantage of requiring the page to be reload each time the language was changed. Unfortunately, due to the database being lost, most of the UI and functionality is gone.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The second prototype made use of React to build the UI, this worked much better since it did not rely on PHP nor did it require the website to be reloaded each time the language was changed. Instead, a JSON file contained the key-value pairs and the i8N module was imported in NPM to load the JSON. \n            There was no database for this prototype during the time it was developed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We also had to think also think about UI and UX for the designs, and making sure the website was visible to search engines for a good SEO index rank.\n            I also aimed to make sure that the site looked and fucntioned the same on a mobile device. Finally we looked at how to host the website. It was decided that we would set up a web server using NginX and Google cloud.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Unfortunately, the project was never picked up. While the clients was very excited when the prototypes presented, \n            internal difficulties meant this project was not given the go ahead.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"projectInfoCol2\">\n          <p>Date: 2019 - 2020</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default BusyBackpack;"],"sourceRoot":""}
