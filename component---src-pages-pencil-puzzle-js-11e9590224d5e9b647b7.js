The rules are that each shape can only contain a fixed amount of cells. So if a cell had the number 4 in it, it had to have four cells for the shape. Each shape could only be rectangular, could not overlap other shapes and all cells in the grid had to be part of a shape. Next, i looked if Shikaku was NP-Complete, this was challenging to find however other published papers had references that Shikaku was NP-Complete, although finding these papers could not be achieved. Next, each puzzle required a representation and a sequence of moves. The representation was how the puzzle would appear on the terminal window, this was fairly simple. For Shikaku i decided to represent this puzzle by having each shape represented by a letter, with each cell that is part of the shape having the same letter. The sequence of moves was how the selected algorithm would select which shape to do first and how the algorithm would complete the puzzle. For Shikaku i decided the shape would be grown out from the origin (the starting cell that contained a number which was the number of cells the shape had to contain) cell."),l.createElement("p",null,"Once each puzzle was developed each puzzle was added to a platform called PPEC, PPEC was provided by our project supervisor which contained all the algorithms and other NP-Complete pencil puzzles.
