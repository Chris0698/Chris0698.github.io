We made a class diagram to show all the class names, variables, methods and interfaces used. Code quality such as coupling and cohesion was checked, and the assignment required to use object oriented design patterns. Patterns used for our implementation was: MVP (Model, View, Presenter), Object Factory and Decorator. The assignment additionally required the solution to be developed using a three-tier architecture approach: the presentational layer, the domain layer and data access layer. For the UI layer we used the MVP pattern to communicate with the domain layer. For the data access layer, an ORM was used, which was ADO.net Entity Framework, making use of LINQ queries to get data. Dependency injection was used throughout the implementation. Finally, a test project had to be created which contained unit tests for all aspects of the system.")),n.createElement("div",{className:"projectInfoCol2"},n.createElement("p",null,"Date: 2019 - 2020"),n.createElement("p",null,"Module Mark: 90"),n.createElement("p",{className:"cardLanguage"},"C# with .Net Framework + ADO.Net"),n.createElement("a",{target:"_blank",rel:"noopener no referrer",href:"https://github.com/Chris0698/BookingSystemAssignment",className:"codeButton"},"View Code"))),n.createElement(i.Link,{to:"/#projects",className:"backToProjectsButton"},"Back To Projects"))}}}]);
