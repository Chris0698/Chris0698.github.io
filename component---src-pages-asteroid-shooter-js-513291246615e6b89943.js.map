For this assignment, a basic \"engine\", developed using C++ and DirectX9, was provided. The assignment\n                      was to develop the engine further and to improve the code cohesion while having minimal coupling\n                      between the classes. Design documentation, a class diagram and multiple sequence diagrams, with a short essay \n                      of the limitation of the engine were required. Finally, a small game had to be created to make use of the engine however game playability was not assessed.\n                      A simple game of shooting asteroids using a player-controlled ship was developed to satisfy this requirement. To improve the provided base engine different classes such as a player class,\n                      asteroid class, a game object and a game object manager class, where originally all the logic code was placed inside one Update method. I also had to manage memory leaks that can occur due to pointers, to \n                      handle this I used smart pointers throughout.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>An advanced component of the game was required which was to have a component-based architecture for the game objects. Each game object: bullets,\n                      player ship, explosions and asteroid had its components that handled player input, collision and health where appropriate. Each component such as ship collision \n                      overrides an abstract method from a Component super class so new components could be created and can be added to each object. A factory design pattern was additionally used for creating new game objects.  \n                  </p>\n                  <p>\n                  This assignment helped with my debugging skills, using the Visual Studio debugging tools, to check for why a null pointer occurred or looking for why unexpected behavior occurred during development.\n                  </p>\n                  <p>Additionally, in my spare time, I am working on improving this further by using a sprite sheet, adding a HUD, and add more levels of various difficulty.\n\n                  </p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"projectInfoCol2\">\n                  <p>Date: 2018 - 2019</p>\n                  <p>Module Mark: 82</p>\n                  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Chris0698/AsteroidGame\" className=\"codeButton\">View Code</a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <Link to=\"/#projects\" className=\"backToProjectsButton\">Back To Projects</Link>\n        </Layout>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default AsteroidShooter;"],"sourceRoot":""}
