Their current website had no membership capabilities, user login/sign up capabilities, multilginual support and no area where members could share their creative ideas.

This is where i presented this prototype to show that it was possible."),n.createElement("p",null,"Effecitivty what i produced where two prototypes, one made in React and had no application backend, where the other prototype was made using HTML and did have a PHP backend with a database.

Both prototypes followed the design set in the existing website and added the extra features on top."),n.createElement("p",null,"The first prototype produced in HTML and OOPHP showed how the membership sign up and log in worked. Users would sign in to the site and when looking at events, they show if they were interested in the event, or going, byclicking on a button, and in the admin page, the admin could see a list of how many clicked like or interested. This prototype also featured changing the page language through a link in the top right of the page. This worked by loading a .ini file which contained key value pairs for each translation, while in the PHP code, the .ini file would be loaded, then each word would be set. This did have a disadvantage of requriing the page to reload each time the language was changed. Unofrtuantly, due to the database being lost, most of the UI functionality is gone."),n.createElement("p",null,"The second prototype made use of React to build the UI, without relying on PHP backend for the language switching. Language switching was handled much better in this version. Instead, a JSON file contained the key, values and the i8N module was imported in NPM to load the JSON. This meant that the webpage was never reloaded on language switching. There was no database for this prototype during the time it was developed."),n.createElement("p",null,"Unofrtuantly, the project was never picked up.
