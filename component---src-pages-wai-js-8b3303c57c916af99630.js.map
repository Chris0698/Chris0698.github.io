where i had to produce a SPA to display films in a database.\n            Each film could be selected to show extra details about each film. The user could log into the app, \n            and if they were logged in, every time they selected a film, a note editor would be displayed, where a note could be added/edited, or deleted.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            HTML5 fragments were created to provide the UI elements such as the film details plane, note editor and were styled by using \n            CSS3. AngularJS was used to \"stitch\" the elements together and to make the website a single-page application. \n            To begin i created a route provider and a controller for functionality like film click, logging in, closing the note editor, etc. \n            A data service JS file was created as a middle man between the front-end controller and the PHP service pipe (explained next paragraph).\n            The data service contained multiple functions which each used data promises and returned the promise to the controller which was the result of the PHP service pipe. \n            The controller then parsed the data and bind the results to the HTML fragments before they were displayed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Additionally, a search and filter by category was provided, this made calls to the database on category change, or every entered word\n            without the need of refreshing the page.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The application backend was made in Object-Oriented PHP. I had different classes such as a file writer (for error logging) an application registry class for user log-in data,\n            and a record set class for generating JSON or XML from a database query. \n            Additionally, i had a \"service pipe\" PHP file where the JS data service file would pass arguments to, and inside the PHP service pipe file it had different SQL to \n            select and update data, depending on the arguments passed. These queries made use of the JSON recordset class and the result was JSON encoded and echoed out for the JS files. \n            Try-catch blocks were used for each query and the exception was error logged.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Finally, a testing page was provided to test each element such as log in and getting films to make sure everything was still working during development.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"projectInfoCol2\">\n          <p>Date: 2019</p>\n          <p>Module mark: 80</p>\n          <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Chris0698/WebApp\" className=\"codeButton\">View Code</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default WAI"],"sourceRoot":""}
