Each film could be selected \n            to show extra details about each film. The user could log into the app, and if they were logged in, everytime they selected \n            a film, a note editor would be displayed, where a note could be added/editted or deleted.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            HTML5 fragments were created to provide the UI elements such as the film details plane, note editor and was styled by using CSS3.\n            AngularJS was used to \"stich\" the elements togthers and to make the website a single page application. To begin i created a route provider and \n            a controller for functionality like film click, logging in, closing the note editor etc. A data service JS file was created as a middle man \n            between the front end controller and the PHP service pipe (explained next paragraph). The data service contained multiple functions which each used \n            data promises and returned the promise to the controller which was the result from the PHP service pipe. The controller then parsed the data and \n            binded the results to the HTML fragments before they were displayed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The application backend was made in Object Oreiented PHP. I had different classes such as a file writer (for error logging)\n            an appliaction registry class for user log in data, and a record set class for generating JSON or XML from a database query. Additionally i had \n            a \"service pipe\" PHP file where the JS data servuce file would pass arguements to, and inside the PHP service pipe file it had different SQL to select and undate \n            data, depending on the arguements passed. These queries made use of the JSON record set class and the result was JSON encoded and echoed out for the \n            JS files. Try-catch blocks was used for each query and the exception was error logged.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"projectInfoCol2\">\n          <p>Date: 2019</p>\n          <p>Module mark: 80</p>\n          <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Chris0698/WebApp\" className=\"codeButton\">View Code</a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default WAI"],"sourceRoot":""}
