Elements from the dictionary were randomly selected, wuth the amount selected dependant on the number of main balls selected for the game (5 for Thunderball and 6 for Lotto). These elements are checked that if the boolean has been selected is false, if it true then another element in the dictionary is selected, and the process repeats. The number in the element is added to an array and the array is then organised smallest to largest. Finally, the bonus balls are drawn. For thunderball the bonus ball is one random number selected between 1 - 14, for Lotto i got the bonus ball in the same manner was the regular balls are generated."),r.createElement("p",null,"The database was a local SQL Server database that part of Visual Studio. This was a code-first approach.

This made use of the draw class that contained the properties for each of these elements. For version 2 i will have two separate tables and have a Thunderball draw class and a Lotto draw class extend off of Draw.
